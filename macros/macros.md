<#macro how_to_complete_this_guide jump_ahead='Create a resource representation class'>
How to complete this guide
--------------------------

Like all Spring's [Getting Started guides](/guides/gs), you can start from scratch and complete each step, or you can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.

To **start from scratch**, move on to [Set up the project](#scratch).

To **skip the basics**, do the following:

 - [Download][zip] and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using [Git][u-git]:
`git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/${project_id}.git`
 - cd into `${project_id}/initial`.
 - Jump ahead to [${jump_ahead}](#initial).

**When you're finished**, you can check your results against the code in `${project_id}/complete`.

<#macro build_system_intro>
First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with [Gradle](http://gradle.org) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is included here. If you're not familiar with either, refer to [Building Java Projects with Gradle](/guides/gs/gradle/) or [Building Java Projects with Maven](/guides/gs/maven).
</#macro>

<#macro android_build_system_intro>
In this section you set up a basic build script and then create a simple application. 

> **Note:** If you are new to Android projects, before you proceed, refer to [Installing the Android Development Environment](/guides/gs/android/) to help you configure your development environment.

You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with [Gradle](http://gradle.org) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is included here. If you're not familiar with either, refer to [Building Android Projects with Gradle](/guides/gs/gradle-android/) or [Building Android Projects with Maven](/guides/gs/maven-android/).

<#macro build_an_executable_jar_mainhead>
Build an executable JAR
-----------------------
</#macro>


<#macro build_an_executable_jar_subhead>
### Build an executable JAR
</#macro>

<#macro build_an_executable_jar>
Now that your `Application` class is ready, you simply instruct the build system to create a single, executable jar containing everything. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

Add the following configuration to your existing Maven POM:

`pom.xml`
```xml
    <properties>
        <start-class>hello.Application</start-class>
    </properties>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

The `start-class` property tells Maven to create a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file with a `Main-Class: hello.Application` entry. This entry enables you to run it with `mvn spring-boot:run` (or simply run the jar itself with `java -jar`).

The [Spring Boot maven plugin][spring-boot-maven-plugin] collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.

Now run the following command to produce a single executable JAR file containing all necessary dependency classes and resources:

```sh
$ mvn package
```

[spring-boot-maven-plugin]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin

> **Note:** The procedure above will create a runnable JAR. You can also opt to [build a classic WAR file](/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/) instead.
</#macro>

<#macro build_an_executable_jar_with_gradle>
Now that your `Application` class is ready, you simply instruct the build system to create a single, executable jar containing everything. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

Update your Gradle `build.gradle` file's `buildscript` section, so that it looks like this:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot" }
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:0.5.0.M4")
    }
}
```

Further down inside `build.gradle`, add the following to the list of applied plugins:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'spring-boot'
```

The [Spring Boot gradle plugin][spring-boot-gradle-plugin] collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
It also searches for the `public static void main()` method to flag as a runnable class.

Now run the following command to produce a single executable JAR file containing all necessary dependency classes and resources:

```sh
$ ./gradlew build
```

Now you can run the JAR by typing:

```sh
$ java -jar build/libs/${project_id}-0.1.0.jar
```

[spring-boot-gradle-plugin]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-plugin

Now that your `Application` class is ready, you simply instruct the build system to create a single, executable jar containing everything. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

Below are the Gradle steps, but if you are using Maven, you can find the updated pom.xml [right here](https://github.com/spring-guides/${project_id}/blob/master/complete/pom.xml) and build it by typing `mvn clean package`.

Update your Gradle `build.gradle` file's `buildscript` section, so that it looks like this:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot" }
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:0.5.0.M4")
    }
}
```

Further down inside `build.gradle`, add the following to the list of applied plugins:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'spring-boot'
```
You can see the final version of `build.gradle` [right here]((https://github.com/spring-guides/${project_id}/blob/master/complete/build.gradle).

The [Spring Boot gradle plugin][spring-boot-gradle-plugin] collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
It also searches for the `public static void main()` method to flag as a runnable class.

Now run the following command to produce a single executable JAR file containing all necessary dependency classes and resources:

```

If you are using Gradle, you can run the JAR by typing:

```sh
$ java -jar build/libs/${project_id}-0.1.0.jar

If you are using Maven, you can run the JAR by typing:

```sh
$ java -jar target/${project_id}-0.1.0.jar
```

<#macro build_the_application>
Build the application
------------------------

To build this application, you need to add some extra bits to your pom.xml file.

```xml
	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>2.1</version>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<phase>package</phase>
						<goals>
							<goal>shade</goal>
						</goals>
						<configuration>
							<transformers>
								<transformer
									implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
									<mainClass>hello.Application</mainClass>
								</transformer>
							</transformers>
						</configuration>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
```

The [Maven Shade plugin][maven-shade-plugin] extracts classes from all jars on the classpath and builds a single "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.

Now run the following to produce a single executable JAR file containing all necessary dependency classes and resources:

```sh
$ mvn package
```

[maven-shade-plugin]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin
