### Create a Gradle build file
Below is the [initial Gradle build file](https://github.com/spring-guides/${project_id}/blob/master/initial/build.gradle). But you can also use Maven. The pom.xml file is included [right here](https://github.com/spring-guides/${project_id}/blob/master/initial/pom.xml). If you are using [Spring Tool Suite (STS)][gs-sts], you can import the guide directly.

    <@snippet path="build.gradle" prefix="initial"/>
    
[gs-sts]: /guides/gs/sts
